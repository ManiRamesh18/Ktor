# Ktor CRUD Sample

Welcome to the Ktor CRUD Sample repository! This project serves as an example of building a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application using Ktor, a powerful Kotlin framework for building web/android/ios applications.

## Overview

In this sample project, we've created a basic server application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations on a list of customers. This can serve as a starting point for building more complex applications with Ktor.

The key features of this project include:

- **Create**: You can add new customer to the list.
- **Read**: You can view the list of customer.
- **Update**: You can update existing customer.
- **Delete**: You can delete customer from the list.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Ktor CRUD sample on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManiRamesh18/Ktor.git
   ```

2. **Build and Run**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to build and run the Ktor application:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

   This will start the Ktor application locally.

3. **Access the App**: Open your web browser and go to `[http://localhost:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080)`. You should see the CRUD web application. Check CustomerTest.http for the URL.

4. **Perform CRUD Operations**: You can now perform the CRUD operations by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting customer in the application.
